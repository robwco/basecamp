	<h1 class="text-6xl text-center">project: groupbuzz’s marketing website redesign (exploration)</h1>
	<h3>before</h3>
	<p>this is a marketing website for an app i worked on last week. the app excels at organizing email discussions but is currently positioned as an app for hosting online communities. the app has struggled to gain traction in this market so i explored rebranding and repositioning it.</p>

	<h3>after</h3>
	<p>i spent a couple hours updating the branding for the site in figma and targeting a new use case: group email discussions. this opens up the app to a broader market and highlights its best features.</p>
