			the previous version of the app had a fun and distinctive navigation system but presented some usability problems:</p>

		<ul class="list-outside list-disc mb-12">
			<li class="mb-6">using these button/tabs was confusing because you expected a button labeled "Process" to actually process something when clicked. it instead takes you to the process page.</li>
			<li class="mb-6">it also doesn't indicate where you were inside the app very well. the triangle indicator below the tab looks like a tooltip instead of a tab.</li>

		<p class="mt-6 mb-12">
			my goal was to keep the look of the tabs but fix the usability problems they presented. it was a bit of a challenge and took longer than i expected to come to a solution. almost everything i tried either lost the distinctive colors or presented new usability problems. the solution was to:</p>

			<ul class="list-outside list-disc mb-12">
				<li class="mb-6">rename the process tab to “Inbox” which makes it more clear you’re not taking an action.</li>
				<li class="mb-6">lose the triangle to indicate which tab you’re on, and instead use animations and shading.</li>
