			<div class="callout before mx-auto text-lg">before</div>

		<p class="mt-6 mb-12">
			the previous version of the app had a fun and distinctive navigation system but presented some usability problems:</p>

		<ul class="list-outside list-disc mb-12">
			<li class="mb-6">using these button/tabs is confusing because you expect a button labeled "Process" to actually process something when clicked. it instead takes you to the process page.</li>
			<li class="mb-6">it also doesn't indicate where you are inside the app very well. the triangle indicator below the tab looks like a tooltip instead of a tab.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="mb-12">my goal was to keep the feel of the colors and tabs but fix the usability problems they presented.

			<div class="callout after mx-auto text-lg">after</div>
		</div>
		<p class="mt-6 mb-12">
			it was a big challenge to redesign these tabs and took a long time to come to a solution. almost everything i tried either lost the distinctive colors or presented new usability problems. the solution was to:</p>

			<ul class="list-outside list-disc mb-12">
				<li class="mb-6">rename the process tab to “Inbox” which makes it more clear you’re not taking an action but instead going somewhere.</li>
				<li class="mb-6">close the triangle to indicate which tab you’re on, and instead use shading and hover animations.</li>
			</ul>
